He obtained the bachelor’s degree in Earth and environmental sciences fromToursUniversity in 2014 and themaster’s degree in plan- etary geosciences from Nantes University in 2016. During his PhD, obtained in 2019, working with Cerema and Ifsttar French institutes, he developed a fusion methodol- ogy to combine spatialized geophysical and punctual geotechnical data in order to improve dike diagnosis. This methodology relies on the use of belief functions. He has collaborated with EDF (French Electric utility company) in order to apply this methodology to their hydraulic works. In 2021, he has co-organized the francophone “First National Information Fusion Seminar for theCharacterization of PorousMedia: Applications toGeosciences andCivil Engineering”with the French INRAE Institute and Clermont-Auvergne University.He has published three international articles and participated in over ten international and national conferences, he has also been re- viewing geophysical articles for international journals. JeanDezert graduated fromEFREIEngineering School in Paris in 1985,and obtained the Ph.D degree in automatic control and signal processing from the University Paris XI, Orsay, France in 1990. During 1986–1990, he did research in multi-sensor multi- target tracking (MS-MTT) at the French Aerospace Research Lab (ONERA),Châtil- lon, France. During 1991–1992, he visited the ESE Department at UConn University inUSA as Post-doc Research Fellow under supervision of Professor Bar-Shalom.Dur- ing 1992–1993, he was a Teaching Assistant in Electrical Engineering Department at Orléans University, France. He joined ONERA in 1993, where he is a Maître de Recherches and Senior Research Scientist. His current research interests include esti- mation theory with applications to MS-MTT, information fusion, plausible reasoning under uncertainty, and decision-making support. He is a Reviewer for several inter- national journals. He has worked for the development of the International Society of Information Fusion (www.isif.org) and served in its Board. He was President of ISIF in 2016.Dr.Dezert has been involved in the Technical ProgramCommittees of several International Conferences on Information Fusion.He gave several seminars, lectures, and tutorials on information fusion and tracking in Europe, USA, Canada, Australia, and China during the last two decades. He has published several book chapters, 160 papers in conferences, and around 70 papers in journals. He has also co-edited sev- eral books with Professor Smarandache on information fusion related to DSmT for information fusion. For more information, see www.onera.fr/fr/staff/jean-dezert. IMPROVEMENT OF PROPORTIONAL CONFLICT REDISTRIBUTION RULES 73 www.isif.org Florentin Smaradache is a Professor of Mathematics at the University of New Mex- ico, USA. He got the MSc degree in mathematics and computer science from the University of Craiova, Romania, PhD in mathematics from the State University of Kishinev, and postdoctoral in applied mathematics from Okayama University of Sci- ences, Japan.He is the Founder of Neutrosophy (generalization of dialectics),Neutro- sophic Set, Logic, Probability and Statistics since 1995 and has published hundreds of papers and books on neutrosophic physics, superluminal and instantaneous physics, unmatter, quantum paradoxes, absolute theory of relativity, redshift and blueshift due to the medium gradient and refraction index besides the Doppler effect, paradox- ism, outerart, neutrosophy as a new branch of philosophy, law of included multiple- middle, multispace and multistructure, hypersoft set, degree of dependence and inde- pendence between neutrosophic components, refined neutrosophic set, neutrosophic over-under-off-set, plithogenic set, neutrosophic triplet and duplet structures, quadru- ple neutrosophic structures, extension of algebraic structures to NeutroAlgebras and AntiAlgebras, DSmT, and so on to many peer-reviewed international journals and many books and he presented papers and plenary lectures to many international con- ferences around the world. In addition, he published many books of poetry, dramas, children’ stories, translations, essays, novel, folklore collections, traveling memories, and art albums.
