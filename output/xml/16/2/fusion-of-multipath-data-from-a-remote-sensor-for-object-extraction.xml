In the same year, after a national competition, he was awarded the position of Pro- fessore Associato at the Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica e delle Telecomuni- cazioni at Universit degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Italy, where he has been until October 2000. In February 2000, he was nominated Full Professor of Telecommuni- cation Engineering after a national competition and appointed in November 2000 at Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell’Informazione, Universit della Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Aversa, Italy. His research interests are in the areas of signal processing, communications, information theory, and machine learning. Francesco Palmieri was the recipient in 1999, with S. Marano and G. Franceschetti, of the S. A. Schelkunof Award for the best paper of the year on IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propa- gation. Francesco A. N. Palmieri is also a Visiting Research Scholar at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Connecticut, Storrs CT, USA. Braham Himed received the engineer degree in electrical engineering from Ecole Nationale Polytechnique of Algiers, Algeria, in 1984, and the M.S. and Ph.D. de- grees in electrical engineering from Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, in 1987 and 1990, respectively. Dr. Himed is a Division Research Fellow with the Air Force Re- search Laboratory, Sensors Directorate, Multi-Spectral Sensing and Detection Di- vision, Distributed RF Sensing Branch, in Dayton Ohio, where he is involved with several aspects of radar developments. His research interests include detection, esti- mation, multichannel adaptive signal processing, time series analyses, array process- ing, adaptive processing, waveform diversity, MIMO radar, passive radar, and over the horizon radar.Dr.Himed is the recipient of the 2001 IEEE region I award for his work on bistatic radar systems, algorithm development, and phenomenology.He is a Fellow of the IEEE and amember of the board of governors of the IEEEAerospace and Electronics Systems Society (AESS).
