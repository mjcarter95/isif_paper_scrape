A FUSION ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION TOOL FOR MULTI-SENSOR CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS 151 Rommel N. Carvalho is now a postdoctoral research associate at the Center of Excellence in Command, Control, Communications, Computing and Intelligence (C4I) at George Mason University (GMU). During the 3 years of his Ph.D., he was a graduate research assistant in the Department of Systems Engineering and Operations Research at GMU, VA. He received his Master in Computer Science and his Bachelor of Computer Science from University of Bras´lia, DF, Brazil, in 2008 and 2003, respectively. He is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) researcher with focus on uncertainty in the Semantic Web using Bayesian Inference, Data Mining, Software Engineering and Java Programming. Awarded programmer with experience in implementation of Bayesian Network systems (UnBBayes), Multi- Entity Bayesian Network and Probabilistic Web Ontology Language (PR-OWL), and various web-based applications. Rommel N. Carvalho has been working for the Brazilian Government at the Office of the Comptroller General (CGU) as an Information Technology (IT) expert since 2005. He has also done extensive research on fraud detection and prevention for the Brazilian Government and situation awareness for the U.S. Navy. In most of the systems he helped develop he was the project manager, which gave him the experience necessary to get the Project Management Professional (PMP) certificate. During his Ph.D., he has published over 15 papers, among conference and workshop papers, book chapters, journal papers, and workshop proceedings. Kuo-Chu Chang received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Connecticut in 1983 and 1986 respectively. From 1983 to 1992, he was a senior research scientist in Advanced Decision Systems (ADS) division, Booz-Allen & Hamilton, Mountain View, CA. In 1992, he joined the Systems Engineering and Operations Research Department, George Mason University where he is currently a professor. His research interests include estimation theory, optimization, signal processing, and multisensor data fusion. He is particularly interested in applying unconventional techniques in the conventional decision and control systems. He has more than 25 years of industrial and academic experience and published more than one hundred and fifty papers in the areas of multitarget tracking, distributed sensor fusion, and Bayesian Networks technologies. He was an associate editor on Tracking/Navigation Systems from 1993 to 1996 and on Large Scale Systems from 1996 to 2006 for IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems. He was also an associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part A, from 2002 to 2007. Dr. Chang is a member of Etta Kappa Nu and Tau Beta Pi. 152 JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN INFORMATION FUSION VOL. 7, NO. 2 DECEMBER 2012</unstructured_citation>
