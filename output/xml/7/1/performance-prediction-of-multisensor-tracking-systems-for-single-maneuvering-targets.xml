<unstructured_citation>Applied Optimal Estimation. The M.I.T. Press, Cambridge, MA, 1974. PERFORMANCE PREDICTION OF MULTISENSOR TRACKING SYSTEMS FOR SINGLE MANEUVERING TARGETS 43 W. Dale Blair received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Tennessee Technological University, Cookeville, in 1985 and 1987, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, in 1998. He is a principal research engineer with the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) and currently serves as the technical director for the C2BMC Knowledge Center of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA). While a graduate research assis- tant, Dr. Blair performed robotic controls research for the Center of Excellence of Manufacturing Research and Technology Utilization at Tennessee Technological University. In 1987, he joined the Naval Systems Division of FMC Corporation in Dahlgren, VA as an electrical engineer, where his work involved the development and evaluation of new algorithms for weapons control. In 1990, Dr. Blair joined the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) in Dahlgren, VA. At NSWCDD, he originated two benchmark problems for target tracking and radar re- source allocation, which served as themes for invited sessions at the 1994 and 1995 American Control Conferences. He also led a project that demonstrated through a real-time tracking experiment that modern tracking algorithms can be utilized to reduce the radar time and energy required by a phased array radar to support surveillance tracking. Since joining GTRI in 1997, he has led a multiorganizational team in the development of multiplatform-multisensor-multitarget benchmarks to both air defense and ballistic missile defense. His projects at GTRI focus mostly the modeling and simulation and algorithm assessment associated with the sensor netting for the battle management, command, and control for the ballistic missile de- fense system. He also leads projects related multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) radar, advanced radar data processing, and sensor netting for detection of chemical and biological weapons. Dr. Blair is a Fellow of the IEEE and recipient of the 2001 IEEE Nathanson Award for Outstanding Young Radar Engineer. He served as the Editor for Radar System for IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems (T-AES) 1996— 99 and Editor-In-Chief (EIC) for IEEE T-AES from 1999—2005. He is the founding Editor-In-Chief for the International Journal on Advances in Information Fusion under the International Society for Information Fusion. Dr. Blair also serves on the Board of Governors of IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Society (AESS) from 1998—2003 and 2005—2010. While a member of the IEEE AESS BoG, he served as Associate Vice President for Publications for 2007—10 and Chair of the Strategic Planning Committee for 2009—10, originated the Target Tracking System Panel, and initiated the Systems Panel for Cyber Security Systems. He has received technical awards that include the NSWCDD Technical Excellence Award in 1991 for his contributions to the development of innovative techniques for target trajectory estimation and prediction and the NSWCDD Independent Exploratory Development Excellence Award in 1993. His research interests include radar signal processing and control, resource allocation for multifunction radars, multisensor resource allocation, tracking maneuvering targets, and multisensor integration and data fusion. Dr. Blair’s research is reported in over two hundred articles which include 38 refereed journal articles. He served as a lecturer in 1993, 1994, and 1998 for the UCLA Extension Program in three short courses related to advanced topics in target tracking. He recently originated and coordinates three short courses, Target Tracking in Sensor Systems, Target Tracking Concepts, and Advanced Target Tracking for Ballistic Missile Defense, for the Profession Education Department of the Georgia Institute of Technology. Dr. Blair is coeditor and coauthor of the book, Multitarget-Multisensor Tracking: Advances and Applications III, and the author of chapter 19 “Radar Tracking Algorithms” of the new edition of Principles of Modern Radar. He is also the host and coordinator of the ONR/GTRI Workshop on Target Tracking and Sensor Fusion for 1998 through 2011. 44 JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN INFORMATION FUSION VOL. 7, NO. 1 JUNE 2012</unstructured_citation>
