<unstructured_citation>ANSP Operational Performance, homepage: https://www.canso.org/sites/default/files/ RecommendedKPIforMeasuringANSOOperational Performance.pdf, 2015. Carlos C. Insaurralde is a Senior Lecturer in Electronic Engineering in the Department of Engineering Design and Mathematics, University of the West of England, UK. He is the Programme Leader for BEng(Hons) Robotics, and Module Leader of four Programme Modules. He received the MEng degree in Electronics (recognition of Argentinean qualification as equivalent to the Spanish one) from the National University of Cordoba, Argentina, in 1999, the MAst and PhD degrees in Computer Engineering (Mention “Doctor Europaeus” accredited by the European University Association) from the Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain, in 2005 and 2007 respectively, and the MPhil degree in Electrical Engineering from Heriot-Watt University, UK in 2014. He also received a PgCert in Learning and Teaching in Higher Education from Teesside University, UK in 2017. He is a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA), UK. Dr Insaurralde was a Senior Lecturer in Control and Instrumentation Engineering at Teesside University, UK (2015—2018), and an Assistant Professor (Lecturer) at Heriot-Watt University, UK in 2014. He was also a Research Associate in the Institute of Sensors, Signals and Systems, Heriot-Watt University (2010—2013), and in the Software Systems Engineering Initiative, Loughborough University, UK (2008—2010). Additionally, he held post-doc positions in the Laboratory of Applied Research on Software-Intensive Technologies, Atomic Energy Commission (France, 2008), and the Institute of Production Engineering, Tampere University (Finland, 2006—2007). His research interests are architectures of intelligent and autonomous systems, multidisciplinary development of high-integrity systems, and metric assessment of systems performance. He has worked in different application domains (aerospace, defense, industrial automation, and maritime systems). His research has lately been focused on intelligent automation and autonomy (decision- making support) for Air Traffic Management (ATM). Dr Insaurralde has been involved in several EU-funded projects, MoD-funded projects, and an ANR-funded project (France) under the role of project manager, main researcher, and task leader. He has worked in collaboration with Airbus, EADS, and BAE Systems. He has over twenty years of hands-on experience in software engineering for dependable applications. This includes over ten years of engineering research experience in robotics and autonomous systems. He is author of over eighty international publications, including a book and five book chapters. He is author of fifteen technical project reports. He received the Best Session Paper award from the Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC) in 2004, 2008, 2013, and 2014 as well as an award for significant contribution as section chair for the Navigation section at the DASC in 2016. He is also an instructor for conference tutorials on intelligent control architecture for autonomous unmanned vehicles (IEEE International Systems Conference and DASC).</unstructured_citation>
