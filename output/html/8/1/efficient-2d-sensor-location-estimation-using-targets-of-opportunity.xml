In 2006 he spent a year with the Ruprecht-Karls-Universität, Heidelberg, Ger- many. He currently works at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C. and is an associate editor for the IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine. His research interests lie in the areas of statistical signal processing and tracking. Richard W. Osborne, III received his B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Connecticut in 2004, 2007, and 2012, respectively. He is currently an assistant research professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Connecticut. In addition to his work at the University of Connecticut, he has consulted with a number of outside companies, and helped to develop and teach a short course on tracking and data fusion. His current research interests lie in the fields of estimation theory and information fusion. EFFICIENT 2D SENSOR LOCATION ESTIMATION USING TARGETS OF OPPORTUNITY 87 Krishna R. Pattipati received his B.Tech. degree in electrical engineering with highest honors from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, in 1975, and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in systems engineering from UConn, Storrs, in 1977 and 1980, respectively. He was with ALPHATECH, Inc., Burlington, MA from 1980 to 1986. He has been with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UConn, where he is currently the UTC Professor of Systems Engineering. His current research activities are in the areas of agile planning, diagnosis and prognosis techniques for cyber-physical systems, multi-object tracking, and combinatorial optimization. A common theme among these applications is that they are characterized by a great deal of uncertainty, complexity, and computational intractability. He is a cofounder of Qualtech Systems, Inc., a firm specializing in advanced integrated diagnostics software tools (TEAMS, TEAMS-RT, TEAMS-RDS, TEAMATE), and serves on the board of Aptima, Inc. Dr. Pattipati was selected by the IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC) Society as the Outstanding Young Engineer of 1984, and received the Centennial Key to the Future award. He has served as the Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics–Part B from 1998 to 2001, vice- president for technical activities of the IEEE SMC Society from 1998 to 1999, and as vice-president for conferences and meetings of the IEEE SMC Society from 2000 to 2001. He was corecipient of the Andrew P. Sage Award for the Best SMC Transactions Paper for 1999, the Barry Carlton Award for the Best AES Transactions Paper for 2000, the 2002 and 2008 NASA Space Act Awards for “A Comprehensive Toolset for Model-based Health Monitoring and Diagnosis,” and “Real-time Update of Fault-Test Dependencies of Dynamic Systems: A Comprehensive Toolset for Model-Based Health Monitoring and Diagnostics,” and the 2003 AAUP Research Excellence Award at UCONN. He also won the best technical paper awards at the 1985, 1990, 1994, 2002, 2004, 2005, and 2011 IEEE AUTOTEST Conferences, and at the 1997, 2004 Command and Control Conference. He is an elected Fellow of IEEE and of the Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering.</li>
