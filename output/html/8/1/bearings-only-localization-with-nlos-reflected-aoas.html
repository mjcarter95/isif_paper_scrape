<p>   Bearings-only localization with light-of-sight (LOS) propagation    is well understood. This paper concentrates on bearings-only local-    ization with non-line-of-sight (NLOS) measurements, where target    images arrive at a network of sensors each after a single specu-    lar reflection. The reflecting surface can be 1) flat or 2) circular    (inner side of a circle), and is assumed known. In this paper, we    derive the least squares (LS), Stansfield, and maximum likelihood    (ML) estimators for both cases. As to the former, their estimation    performances are similar to their counterparts in LOS localization:    Stansfield is very close to ML, and both are usually significantly    better than LS. As regards the second, since the target-sensor ge-    ometry has multiple possibilities, the ML solution is extremely intri-    cate. However, if a concentric opaque circle (such as the earth) lies    within the reflecting one, e.g. the earth within the ionospheric layer,    the propagation path becomes unique; a grid search based ML is    available for such a circumstance. ML is computationally intensive    for a circularly reflecting surface; two suboptimal algorithms, LS    and Stansfield, are developed based on small angle approximation.    These algorithms perform differently from those for the flat case:    ML significantly outperforms LS and Stansfield, especially for a    large observation error; however, Stansfield is not necessarily better    than LS.
