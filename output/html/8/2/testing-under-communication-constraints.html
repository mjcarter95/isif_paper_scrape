<p>   The problem of fault diagnosis with communication constraints    is considered. Most approaches to fault diagnosis have been focused    on detecting and isolating a fault under cost constraints such as eco-    nomic factors and computational time. But in some systems, such    as remote monitoring (e.g., satellite, sensor field) systems, there is    a communication constraint between the system being monitored    and the monitoring facility. In such circumstances it is desirable    to isolate the faulty component with as few interactions as possible.    The key consideration is that multiple tests are chosen at each stage    in such a way that the tests within the chosen group complement    each other. To this end we propose two algorithms for fault diag-    nosis under communications constraints. Their performances are    analyzed in terms of the average number of testing stages as well    as in terms of the required computational complexity.
