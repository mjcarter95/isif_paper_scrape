<p>   This research is complementary to research presented in “Es-    tablishment of Human Performance Baseline for Image Fusion Al-    gorithms in the LWIR and MWIR Spectra” by Moyer and Howell    in which we established a baseline performance candidate for image    fusion comparison by investigating the impact of different display    formats on the probability of identification, P(ID), performance of a    human observer. We advance this line of research by measuring the    inherent ability of the human observer to perform an identification    task using source band imagery, long-wave (LW) infrared and short-    wave (SW) infrared that was not algorithmically fused prior to hu-    man observation. A multi-part experiment was conducted where    human observers were asked to identify displayed military targets    using a standard set of tracked military vehicles. The observers    performed the identification (ID) visual discrimination task using    source band imagery concatenated or presented side-by-side on a    single monitor, temporally interlaced source band imagery on a sin-    gle monitor. Observers’ performances using source band imagery    fused with the superposition fusion algorithm was also included as    a reference because it is a well understood algorithm and shares    an assumed similarity with the temporal interlaced display format.    This research proposes that a forced choice human perception ex-    periment is a more meaningful evaluation of an image fusion al-    gorithm’s performance, specifically when the application of the al-    gorithm is for dimensionality reduction to a single image designed    for human observation. The results from this research indentify a    clear performance baseline when assessing human observer P(ID)    performance employing an image fusion algorithm.
