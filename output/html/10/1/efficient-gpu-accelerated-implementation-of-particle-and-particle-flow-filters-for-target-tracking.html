<p>   Particle filtering is a very popular method for nonlinear/non-    Gaussian state estimation, however, implementation of particle fil-    ters (PFs) with a high state dimension in real-time is a very challeng-    ing practical task because the computation is prohibitive. Parallel    & distributed (P&D) computing is a natural way to deal with the    computational challenges of PF methods in order to make them    practical for large scale problems, such as multitarget multisensor    tracking. This paper presents results on development, implementa-    tion and performance evaluation of computationally efficient paral-    lel algorithms for particle and particle flow filters (PFFs) utilizing    a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) as a parallel computing envi-    ronment. Proposed are state-of-the-art parallel PF and PFF imple-    mentations which are optimized for GPU architecture and capa-    bilities. The proposed algorithms are applied and tested, via sim-    ulation, for tracking multiple targets using a pixelized sensor, and    for a high-dimensional nonlinear density estimation problem. It is    demonstrated by the obtained simulation results that the proposed    parallel GPU implementations can greatly accelerate the compu-    tation of both PFs and PFFs, and thereby bring them closer to    practical applications.
