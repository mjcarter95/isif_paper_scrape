<p>   In this paper we show that the standard definition of likelihood    function used in Bayesian inference simply and correctly handles    quantized measurements and imprecise likelihood functions. Some    recent papers have stated or implied that methods involving random    sets, fuzzy membership functions, generalized likelihood functions,    or Dempster-Shafer concepts are required to handle imprecise    likelihood functions and quantized measurements. While it is true    that one can use these methods, in the spirit of Occam’s razor, we    feel the simplest correct solution is the best.    Manuscript received on December 19, 2013; revised April 10, 2014    and April 22, 2014; released for publication May 11, 2014.    Refereeing of this contribution was handled by Jean Dezert.    This is an extended version of the paper “Standard Bayesian ap-    proach to quantized measurements and imprecise likelihoods” pub-    lished at the 16th International Conference on Information Fusion    (Fusion 2013).

Stone obtained his B.S. in mathematics from Antioch College in 1964 and his M.S. and Ph.D. in mathematics from Purdue University in 1965 and 1967. He is Chief Scientist at Metron Inc. He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and a fellow of the Institute for Operations Research and Management Science. In 1975, the Operations Research Society of America awarded the Lanchester Prize to Dr. Stone’s text, Theory of Optimal Search. In 1986, he produced the probability maps used to locate the S.S. Central Americawhich sank in 1857, taking millions of dollars of gold coins and bars to the ocean bottom one and one-half miles below. In 2010 he led the team that produced the probability distribution that guided the French to the location of the underwater wreckage of Air France Flight AF447. He is a coauthor of the 2014 book, Bayesian Multiple Target Tracking. He continues to work on a number of detection and tracking systems for the United States Navy and Coast Guard including the Search And Rescue Optimal Planning System used by the Coast Guard since 2007 to plan searches for people missing at sea.</li>
