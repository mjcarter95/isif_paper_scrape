<p>   The focus of this paper is on the use of ground target kinematics    to estimate the underlying road network on which the vehicles    are assumed to be travelling. Assuming that the road network    can be represented as an amalgamation of straight line segments,    a Hough transform approach is used to identify portion of road    which correspond to straight line segments. Since multiple tracks    can be associated with one segment of the road and since the    track estimates are inherently uncertain, an iterative approach    is presented to identify a parametric representation of the line    segments of the roads using the total least squares cost function.    Cramér-Rao bounds are identified to characterize the bounds on    the uncertainty associated with the proposed approach. A complex    dataset which include multiple tracks is used to illustrate the ability    of the proposed algorithm to identify the underlying road network    and characterize the uncertainty associated with the parametric    estimate of the road.
