<p>   Integration of space based sensors into a Ballistic Missile Defense    System (BMDS) allows for detection and tracking of threats over a    larger area than ground based sensors. This paper examines the ef-    fect of sensor bias error on the tracking quality of a Space Tracking    and Surveillance System (STSS) for the highly non-linear problem    of tracking a ballistic missile. The STSS constellation consists of    two or more satellites (on known trajectories) for tracking ballistic    targets. Each satellite is equipped with an IR sensor that provides    azimuth and elevation to the target. The tracking problem is made    more difficult due to a constant or slowly varying bias error present    in each sensor’s line of sight measurements. The measurements pro-    vided by these sensors are assumed time-coincident (synchronous)    and perfectly associated. The Line Of Sight (LOS) measurements    from the sensors are used to estimate simultaneously the Cartesian    target of opportunity positions, and the sensor biases. The evalu-    ation of the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) on the covariance    of the bias estimates, which serves as a quantification of the avail-    able information about the biases, and the statistical tests on the    results of simulations show that this method is statistically efficient,    even for small sample sizes (as few as two sensors and six points    on the (unknown) trajectory of a single target of opportunity). We    also show that the Root Mean Square (RMS) position error is sig-    nificantly improved with bias estimation compared with the target    position estimation using the original biased measurements.
