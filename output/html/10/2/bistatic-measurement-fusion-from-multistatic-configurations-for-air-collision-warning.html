<p>   A requisite for unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) to operate    within a controlled airspace is a capability to sense and avoid colli-    sions with non-cooperative aircraft. Ground-based transmitters and    UAS-mounted receivers are preferred due to limitations on UAS.    This paper assumes a constant velocity motion of an intruder (tar-    get) aircraft and presents a method to estimate the position and    velocity of the target so as to predict the closest point of approach.    Bistatic range and range rate are assumed the only measurements    available. Several configurations are investigated from a parameter    observability point of view. It turns out that one needs three trans-    mitters in a general three-dimensional scenario to achieve decent    observability of the target motion parameter. With the assumption    that the target is at the same altitude as the ownship, one has a    two-dimensional scenario in which two transmitters are required in    order to have good observability. Simulation results show that the    maximum likelihood (ML) estimate of the target parameter using    an iterated least squares search can be considered as statistically    efficient in both multistatic configurations with good observabil-    ity for the scenarios considered in this paper. The collision warn-    ing can be carried out based on the ML estimate in two different    ways. The first approach is to formulate the collision as a hypothesis    testing problem using a generalized likelihood function. A second,    Bayesian, approach is also presented. The performance of the like-    lihood based collision warning shows that the multistatic configura-    tion with three transmitters is reliable for collision warning but that    the multistatic configuration with two transmitters under the same    target and ownship altitude assumption is prone to false alarms. In    the configuration with three transmitters, the Bayesian approach    yields the similarly reliable collision warning performance as the    likelihood-based approach when they use threshold values of the    same magnitude.
