<p>   The use of angular information in the form of line-of-sight (LOS)    measurements from passive sensors for the purposes of target local-    ization and tracking has been extensively studied. Previous work has    shown that the formation of fused composite measurements from a    minimum number of LOS measurements (two) is statistically effi-    cient, and therefore, the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) pro-    vides a valid measurement noise covariance for the resulting com-    posite measurement. If the LOS measurements are not synchro-    nized, however, the formation of composite measurements is not    possible from two LOS observations. In this paper, two methods    are presented for forming composite measurements when LOS ob-    servations are obtained asynchronously. It is demonstrated that the    minimum number of LOS measurements required from two asyn-    chronous sensors is four, and that both methods provide a statisti-    cally efficient estimate for track initialization.
