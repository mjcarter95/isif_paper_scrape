<p>   1557-6418/20/$17.00 © 2020 JAIF    Track-to-Track Fusion Using  Inside Information From Local  IMM Estimators    RADU VISINA  YAAKOV BAR-SHALOM  PETERWILLETT  DIPAK K. DEY    Anovel approach to the track-to-track fusion (T2TF) of state esti-    mates from interacting multiple-model (IMM) estimators using inside    information [mode-conditioned estimates (MCEs) and mode proba-    bilities] is described in this paper. Fusion is performed on-demand, i.e.,    without conditioning on past track data. The local trackers run IMM    estimators to track a maneuvering target with switching process noise    and they transmitMCEs andmode probabilities to a fusion center.The    fused state posterior probability density is a Gaussian mixture, where    the parameters of the required likelihood functions can be computed    recursively.Mode probabilities are fused by transforming them to log-    ratios and using them as statistical information in the likelihood func-    tion of the mode. This results in consistent data fusion based on known    target and local tracker (IMM) parameters. Simulations show that this    method outperforms the fusion of the local IMM estimator Gaussian-    approximated outputs both in terms of error during target maneuvers    and in terms of the consistency of the mean-squared error (MSE). It is    a generalization of Gaussian T2TF with crosscovariance, and its per-    formance is close to that of centralized measurement fusion (CMF)—    by accounting for the error and log-ratio crosscovariances, the fused    covariance consistency matches the ideal consistency of CMF without    requiring memory of past fused tracks. The method is also shown to    be more accurate, informative, consistent in MSE, and of lower com-    putational and communication cost than Chernoff fusion, a recently    published method for Gaussian mixture fusion.   </p>
