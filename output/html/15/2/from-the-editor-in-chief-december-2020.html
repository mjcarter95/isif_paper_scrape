<p>   The Ubiquity of Multisensor Fusion    The topic of multiple sensor fusion is becoming in-  creasingly mainstream. For example, while cellphones  have long contained cameras, magnetometers, and ac-  celerometers, they now contain LiDAR (Light Detec-  tion andRanging) [1] as well.A smartphone can even be  strapped to one’s arm to serve as a goniometer to mea-  sure the range of motion of a joint [2].Even some smart-  watches have started sporting small W-band radars for  gesture recognition [3].    The cost of sensors is decreasing as their ubiquity  is increasing. This means that opportunities for hobby-  ists abound. For example, while until a few years ago  simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) was  more within the purview of the military, Google has  now started open sourcing software for LiDAR-based  SLAM [4].    Given the diversity of low-cost sensors available  nowadays, it is natural to want to fuse all of the avail-  able information. A prerequisite to sensor fusion is  that one establish a common coordinate system across  sensors. Two papers in this issue address this topic.  The paper “Bias Estimation for Collocated Sensors:  Model Identification and Measurement Fusion” consid-  ers measurement-level registration and fusion of collo-  cated sensors.These could be for autonomous driving,or  perhaps for some augmented reality feature in a smart-  phone. Additionally, the topic of multisensor fusion is  taken up with the paper “Statistically Efficient Multi-  sensor Rotational Bias Estimation for Passive Sensors  Without Target State Estimation,” which addresses fu-  sion between noncollocated passive angle-only sensors.    The third paper of this issue addresses additional  challenges ofmultisensor fusionwhile handling a variety  of target states. Different sensors might not make mea-  surements or produce estimates at the same rate. Addi-  tionally, some sensors might produce estimates in differ-  ent coordinate systems from others. Many off-the-shelf  sensors contain built-in trackers, precluding the possi-  bility of a fully centralized tracking architecture. The  paper “Heterogeneous and Asynchronous Information  Matrix Fusion” addresses such issues. It considers the    JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN INFORMATION FUSION VOL. 15, NO. 2 DECEMBER 2020 71        asynchronous fusion of tracks from sensors in different  coordinate systems.    While the fusion literature primarily focuses on  the fusion of single-model estimates across sensors,  the fourth paper of this issue, entitled “Track-to-Track  Fusion Using Inside Information From Local IMM  Estimators,” discusses how to fuse estimates from  sensors running interactive multiple model (IMM)  estimators. Given the mature state of the multiple-  model-estimation literature, it is good to see that the  time has arrived for an increasing number of multiple-  model-fusion algorithms.    Finally, the ISIF Journal of Advances in Information  Fusion (JAIF) always encourages the submission of ex-  panded papers from the International Conference on In-  formation Fusion.This year’s Fusion conference was vir-  tual for the first time due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Hopefully, the worldwide approval and dissemination of  COVID-19 vaccines (and who knows, maybe even snif-  fer dogs [5]) will prove effective in stemming the out-  break and will allow for the 2021 Fusion conference to  be held as planned in Sun City, South Africa. I look for-    ward to seeing many members of the fusion community  there.    REFERENCES    [1] T. B.
