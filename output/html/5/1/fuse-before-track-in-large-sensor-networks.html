<p>   Recent years have seen a trend towards unmanned multi-sensor    surveillance networks with large numbers of cheap and limited-    performance sensors. While these networks hold significant poten-    tial for surveillance, it is of interest to address fundamental limi-    tations in large-scale implementations. We first introduce a simple    analytical tracker performance model. Analysis of this model sug-    gests that scan-based tracking performance improves with increas-    ing numbers of sensors, but only to a certain point beyond which    degradation is observed. Correspondingly, we address model-based    optimization of the local sensor detection threshold and the number    of sensors. Next, we propose a two-stage tracking approach (fuse-    before-track) as a possible approach to overcoming the difficulties in    large-sensor surveillance, and we illustrate promising performance    results with simulated surveillance data.
