<p>   In this paper a real-time cooperative path decision algorithm  for UAV surveillance is proposed. The surveillance mission includes  multiple objectives: i) navigate the UAVs safely in a hostile environ-  ment; ii) search for new targets in the surveillance region; iii) clas-  sify the detected targets; iv) maintain tracks on the detected targets.  To handle these competing objectives, a layered decision framework  is proposed, in which different objectives are deemed relevant at  different decision layers according to their priorities. Compared to  previous work, in which multiple objectives are integrated into a  single global objective function, this layered decision framework  allows detailed specification of the desired performance for each  objective and guarantees that an objective with high priority will  be better satisfied by eliminating possible compromises from other  less important ones. In addition, specific path decision strategies  that are suited to the individual objectives can be used at different  decision layers. An important objective of the path decision algo-  rithm is to navigate the UAV safely in the hostile environment. To  achieve this, it is shown necessary to increase the time horizon of the  path decisions. In order to overcome the computational explosion of  an optimal multi-step look-ahead path decision strategy, a Rollout  Policy is proposed. This policy has moderate complexity and, when  used in the layered decision framework, it is able to find safe paths  effectively and efficiently. When the number of UAVs is large, the  formation of UAV decision groups based on a nearest neighbor rule  is proposed to control the complexity of the path decision algorithm.  Further flexibility of assigning different objectives to the UAVs is  also discussed. Simulation results show that the proposed path de-  cision algorithm can guide the group of UAVs efficiently and safely  for the multi-objective surveillance mission.
