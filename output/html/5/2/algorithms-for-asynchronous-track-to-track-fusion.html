<p>   Most track-to-track fusion (T2TF) algorithms for distributed    tracking systems in the literature assume that the local trackers are    synchronized. However, in the real world, synchronization cannot    be usually achieved among distributed local trackers where local    measurements are obtained and local tracks are updated at differ-    ent times with different rates. In addition, communication links be-    tween local trackers and the fusion center (FC) are subject to possi-    ble delays, which results in delayed local tracks for the fusion at the    FC. This paper presents and compares algorithms for asynchronous    Track-to-Track Fusion (AT2TF) for the fusion of asynchronous and    delayed tracks. First, the optimal algorithm for AT2TF with no    memory and with partial information feedback (AT2TFwoMpf) is    presented. The algorithm, denoted as AT2TFwoMpfOpt, serves as    the baseline algorithm for performance comparison. Three approx-    imate AT2TF algorithms from the literature are compared with    AT2TFwoMpfOpt and are shown to have consistency problems and    loss in fusion accuracy. Then the Information Matrix Fusion (IMF)    algorithm from the literature is generalized for the fusion of asyn-    chronous tracks. Based on the generalized IMF (GIMF), AT2TF    algorithms are derived for the information configurations with both    partial and full information feedback. These algorithms are shown    to have good consistency and nearly optimal fusion accuracy. Due    to the simplicity of their implementation, these algorithms are ap-    pealing candidates for practical applications.
