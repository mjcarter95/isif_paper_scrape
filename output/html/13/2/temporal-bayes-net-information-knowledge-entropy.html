<p>   Various information measures have been defined on Bayes Nets  (BN) with the assumption that the Bayes Net is stationary. Our  interest is in the utilization of a BN as a component of a real-time,  information-based sensor management system wherein the dynam-  ics of the situation cause changes both in the structure and underly-  ing probabilities of the nodes in the BN. If a BN is used to represent  the situation assessment (SA) of an environment as a result of our  observations of that environment, we can say that the BN repre-  sents our knowledge about the situation in the form of a temporal  Bayes net (TBN). If one were to not observe the processes in an  environment with additional sensor observations, then the underly-  ing probabilities of at least some of the BN nodes diffuse at a rate  dependent on the dynamics of the process whose uncertainty is rep-  resented by that node, hence the use of the modifier temporal. This  loss of knowledge in the form of increasing uncertainty results in  information flow from the TBN, or, as we refer to it here, temporal  information loss. In order to compensate for this temporal informa-  tion loss and maintain or improve our knowledge of an environment,  the environment needs to be observed by obtaining data. We focus  in this paper on choosing a global TBN information measure In  doing so, we differentiate between aleatory nodes with stationary  uncertainties and epistemic nodes with temporal uncertainties, as  well as formulate a dynamic representation of these temporal un-  certainties. We provide several examples of temporal information  loss under different dynamic assumptions.
