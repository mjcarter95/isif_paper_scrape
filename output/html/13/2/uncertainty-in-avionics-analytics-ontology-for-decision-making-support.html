<p>   With the growing congestion in the airspace, Air Traffic Man-    agement (ATM) requires advances in massive data processing, so-    phisticated avionics techniques, coordination with weather updates,    and assessment of multiple types of uncertainty. The complex situ-    ation overwhelms pilots and ATM controllers. To provide depend-    able artificial decision-making support for ATM and Unmanned    Aerial System Traffic Management (UTM) systems, ontologies are    an attractive knowledge technology. This paper proposes an Avion-    ics Analytics Ontology (AAO) to bring together different types of    uncertainties including semantic from operators, sensing from navi-    gation, and situation from weather modeling updates. The approach    is aligned with the Uncertainty Representation and Reasoning Eval-    uation Framework (URREF), that develops an uncertainty ontology.    The degree of uncertainty to improve effectiveness in ATM/UTM    decision-making processes quantifies information veracity; in ad-    dition to accuracy, timeliness, and confidence. Application exam-    ples are presented that involves two ATM/UTM operation scenarios    where Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) fly nearby commercial    aircraft and/or airports which requires situation awareness safety    response. As compared to a baseline approach without Automatic    Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), results from recorded    ADS-B data demonstrate a over 0.75 veracity improvement) from    Newark Liberty International Airport.

His research interests are architectures of intelligent and autonomous systems, multidisciplinary development of high-integrity systems, and metric assessment of systems performance. He has worked in different application domains (aerospace, defense, industrial automation, and maritime systems). His research has lately been focused on intelligent automation and autonomy (decision- making support) for Air Traffic Management (ATM). Dr Insaurralde has been involved in several EU-funded projects, MoD-funded projects, and an ANR-funded project (France) under the role of project manager, main researcher, and task leader. He has worked in collaboration with Airbus, EADS, and BAE Systems. He has over twenty years of hands-on experience in software engineering for dependable applications. This includes over ten years of engineering research experience in robotics and autonomous systems. He is author of over eighty international publications, including a book and five book chapters. He is author of fifteen technical project reports. He received the Best Session Paper award from the Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC) in 2004, 2008, 2013, and 2014 as well as an award for significant contribution as section chair for the Navigation section at the DASC in 2016. He is also an instructor for conference tutorials on intelligent control architecture for autonomous unmanned vehicles (IEEE International Systems Conference and DASC).</li>
