<p>   In this paper we provide a new methodology using an exoatmo-    spheric target of opportunity seen in a satellites borne sensor’s field    of view to estimate the sensor’s biases simultaneously with the state    of the target. Each satellite is equipped with an Infra Red (IR) sen-    sor that provides the Line Of Sight (LOS) measurements azimuth    and elevation to the target. The measurements provided by these    sensors are assumed to be noisy but perfectly associated, i.e., it is    known perfectly that they belong to the same target. The evaluation    of the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) on the covariance of the    bias estimates, and the statistical tests on the results of simulations    show that both the target trajectory and the biases are observable    and this method is statistically efficient.
