<p>   This paper investigates the problem of deploying a network of    passive sensors to estimate the positions of an unknown number    of stationary transient emitters. Since a completely connected net-    work, which has a link between every pair of nodes, is not feasi-    ble because of the power and bandwidth constraints, we developed    a distributed algorithm that relies only on local communications    between neighboring sensors. This distributed algorithm requires    information diffusion within the network with the goal that every    node achieves all target location estimates as accurate as a fusion    center with centralized access to all information. The locations of    the emitters are not completely observable by any single sensor since    bearings and times of arrival with origin uncertainty are the only    available measurements. These measurements are modeled as a re-    alization of a Poisson point process at each sensor. The problem is    formulated as a constrained optimization problem, which is solved    via an alternating direction method of multipliers in a distributed    manner based on the expectation maximization and averaging con-    sensus algorithms. Consensus on the number of candidate targets    as well as the inter-node estimate association are addressed so that    the distributed algorithm converges to the maximum likelihood es-    timate. A likelihood function based approach using the estimated    probability of detection is presented to determine the number of    targets. Simulation results show that the distributed algorithm con-    verges very fast and the root mean square error of target locations    is almost as small as that obtained using the centralized algorithm.    It is also shown that one can accurately determine the number of    targets using the estimated probability of detection.
