<p> SRS Technologies    Advanced optimization-based algorithms for sensor resource    management have been the research focus area in multisensor track-    ing and fusion in the last decade. These algorithms for the most    part offer the potential for automating the sensor control process    in response to level 1 sensor data fusion (object or track-level) esti-    mates. However, previous studies have indicated that these types of    sensor resource management algorithms may have limited value in    certain operational scenarios involving multi-platform surveillance    and strike missions because the response is optimized for track    maintenance without any assessment of overall situation context.    In this paper, we will develop a framework for representing the    expected information value of planned sensor measurements as it    contributes to higher-level situation inferences. Specifically, a hier-    archical target valuation model that estimates target value on the    basis of not only a level 1 valuation function but also on the basis    of a level 2 valuation function will be presented. These algorithms    will provide for improved tracking and classification performance    when identifying higher-level units such as convoys of vehicles. The    valuation models rely on a computationally efficient implementation    of Bayesian modeling and inference algorithms. Note that the main    focus of the paper is on developing a hierarchical cost function that    captures both level 1 and level 2 objectives and is not on developing    sophisticated techniques for optimizing this objective. Simulation    results which validate the approach are also presented.
