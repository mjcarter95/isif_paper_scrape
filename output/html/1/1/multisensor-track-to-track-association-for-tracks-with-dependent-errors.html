<p> University of New Orleans    The problem of track-to-track association has been considered    until recently in the literature only for pairwise associations. In view    of the extensive recent interest in multisensor data fusion, the need    to associate simultaneously multiple tracks has arisen. This is due    primarily to bandwidth constraints in real systems, where it is not    feasible to transmit detailed measurement information to a fusion    center but, in many cases, only local tracks. As it has been known in    the literature, tracks of the same target obtained from independent    sensors are still dependent due to the common process noise [2].    This paper derives the exact likelihood function for the track-to-    track association problem from multiple sources, which forms the    basis for the cost function used in a multidimensional assignment    algorithm that can solve such a large scale problem where many    sensors track many targets. While a recent work [14] derived the    likelihood function under the assumption that the track errors    are independent, the present paper incorporates the (unavoidable)    dependence of these errors.
