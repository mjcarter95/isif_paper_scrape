<p>   1557-6418/19/$17.00 © 2019 JAIF    Conditions for MHT to be an  Exact Bayesian Solution to the  Multiple Target Tracking  Problem for  Target-to-Measurement  Association Hypotheses    LAWRENCE D. STONE    This paper finds conditions under which multiple hypothesis    tracking (MHT) is an exact Bayesian solution to the multiple target    tracking problem for target-to-measurement association hypotheses.    The crucial condition is that measurements arrive in scans from one or    more sensors, but otherwise the conditions areminimally restrictive. In    order to produce a computationally feasible implementation of MHT,    some approximations must be made, but this true is for any (existing)    method of producing an exact Bayesian solution. Limiting the num-    ber of hypotheses considered is an example of such an approximation.    This paper is motivated by recent claims that MHT is not theoretically    rigorous or “Bayes optimal.”   </p>
