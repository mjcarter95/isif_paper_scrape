<p> Laboratory, Laurel, MD 20723, USA.  This project was supported under the NSF Enriched Doctoral Train-  ing Program entitled “TeamTrainingMathematical Scientists Through  Industrial Collaborations,” DMS Award #1514808.    1557-6418/19/$17.00 © 2019 JAIF    Performance Improvement of  Measurement Association  Using a System with two 2D  Sensors and one 3D Sensor    CÉSAR CONTRERAS  JOHN LANGFORD  LARRY AMMANN  JOHN ZWECK  BRIANMARKS    A measurement-to-measurement data association problem is    formulated for a target tracking system consisting of one or two    2D sensors and a 3D sensor. Operating conditions are identified    under which performance is improved by using two 2D sensors and    a 3D sensor instead of one 2D sensor and a 3D sensor. To facilitate    this study, two algorithms are introduced to compute near-optimal    solutions of the corresponding three-way assignment problem: a    single-step algorithm based on two independent two-way assignment    problems, and a related iterative algorithm that explicitly enforces    a compatibility condition between measurements made by the 2D    sensors. Simulation studies show that the position estimates obtained    with the three-sensor system are much more accurate than those    obtained with a two-sensor system whenever there is large uncertainty    in the 3D sensor in the dimension orthogonal to the plane of the 2D    sensor in the two-sensor system. Moreover, whenever there is large    uncertainty in the measurements from the 3D sensor in the common    dimension of the 2D sensors, the percentage of correct matches with    the the iterative assignment algorithm for the three-sensor system is    significantly better than that with a two-sensor system. The degree to    which the methods and results can be extended to more realistic 3D    radar and 2D camera models is discussed and inferences for aerospace    and missile defense applications are drawn.   </p>
