<p>   The problem of localizing an unknown number of stationary tran-    sient emitters using passive sensors in the presence of missed detec-    tions and false alarms is investigated. Each measurement is based on    one detection by a passive sensor and consists of a time of arrival and    a bearing. It is assumed that measurements within a short time inter-    val have to be associated before estimation. Both a Bernoulli mea-    surement model and a Poisson measurement model are considered    for each target. These two measurement models lead to two differ-    ent proposed problem formulations: one is an S-dimensional (S-D)    assignment problem and the other is a cardinality selection problem.    The former can be solved by the Lagrangian relaxation algorithm re-    liably when the number of sensors is small. The sequentialm-best 2-D    (SEQ[m(2-D)]) assignment algorithm, which is resistant to the ghost-    ing problem due to the estimation of the emitter signal’s emission time,    is developed to solve the problem when the number of sensors be-    comes large. Simulation results show that the SEQ[m(2-D)] assign-    ment algorithm is efficient for real-time processing with reliable asso-    ciations and estimates. In the cardinality selection formulation, a list of    measurements is modeled as either realizations of a random variable    with a uniform–Gaussian mixture (UGM) density or a Poisson point    process (PPP).Because of an efficient way of incorporating false alarm    rate, the UGM formulation is shown to be a useful alternative to the    Manuscript received March 20, 2016; revised August 19, 2016 and  January 18, 2018; released for publication July 8, 2019.

Simulation studies show that both UGM and PPP    formulations, which are based on the expectation–maximization algo-    rithm, require the right initial estimates to yield reliable localization    results.   </p>
