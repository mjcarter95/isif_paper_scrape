<p>   With a large number of sensors and control units in networked    systems, distributed support vector machines (DSVMs) play a fun-    damental role in scalable and efficient multi-sensor classification    and prediction tasks. However, DSVMs are vulnerable to adver-    saries who can modify and generate data to deceive the system to    misclassification and misprediction. This work aims to design de-    fense strategies for DSVM learner against a potential adversary. We    establish a game-theoretic framework to capture the conflicting in-    terests between the DSVM learner and the attacker. The Nash equi-    librium of the game allows predicting the outcome of learning al-    gorithms in adversarial environments, and enhancing the resilience    of the machine learning through dynamic distributed learning al-    gorithms. We show that the DSVM learner is less vulnerable when    he uses a balanced network with fewer nodes and higher degree.    We also show that adding more training samples is an efficient de-    fense strategy against an attacker. We present secure and resilient    DSVM algorithms with verification method and rejection method,    and show their resiliency against adversary with numerical experi-    ments.
