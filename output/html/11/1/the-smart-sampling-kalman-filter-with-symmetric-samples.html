<p>   Nonlinear Kalman Filters (KFs) are powerful and widely-used    techniques when trying to estimate the hidden state of a stochastic    nonlinear dynamic system. A novel sample-based KF is the Smart    Sampling Kalman Filter (S2KF). It is based on deterministic Gaus-    sian samples which are obtained from an offline optimization pro-    cedure. Although this sampling technique is quite effective, it does    not preserve the point symmetry of the Gaussian distribution. In    this paper, we overcome this issue by extending the S2KF with a    new point-symmetric Gaussian sampling scheme to improve its es-    timation quality. Moreover, we also improve the numerical stability    of the sample computation. This allows us to accurately approx-    imate thousand-dimensional Gaussian distributions using tens of    thousands of optimally placed and equally weighted samples. We    evaluate the new symmetric S2KF by computing higher-order mo-    ments of standard normal distributions and investigate the estima-    tion quality of the S2KF when dealing with symmetric measurement    equations. Additionally, extended object tracking based on many    measurements per time step is considered. This high-dimensional    estimation problem shows the advantage of the S2KF being able to    use an arbitrary number of samples independent of the state dimen-    sion, in contrast to other state-of-the-art sample-based Kalman Fil-    ters. Finally, other estimators also relying on the S2KF’s Gaussian    sampling technique, e.g., the Progressive Gaussian Filter (PGF), will    benefit from the new point-symmetric sampling as well.
