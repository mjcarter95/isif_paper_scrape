<p>   Track-to-track fusion (T2TF) is very important in distributed  tracking systems. Compared to the centralized measurement fusion  (CMF), T2TF can be done at a lower rate and thus has potentially  lower communication requirements. In this paper we investigate the  optimal T2TF algorithms under linear Gaussian (LG) assumption,  which can operate at an arbitrary rate for various information con-  figurations. It is also assumed that the tracking system is synchro-  nized. Namely, all the trackers obtain measurements and do track  updates simultaneously and there are no communication delays be-  tween local trackers and the fusion center (FC). The algorithms  presented in this paper can be generalized to asynchronous scenar-  ios. First, the algorithms for T2TF without memory (T2TFwoM)  are presented for three information configurations: with no, partial  and full information feedback from the FC to the local trackers.  As one major contribution of this paper, the impact of information  feedback on fusion accuracy is investigated. It is shown that using  only the track estimates at the fusion time (T2TFwoM), informa-  tion feedback will have a negative impact on the fusion accuracy.  Then, the algorithms for T2TF with memory (T2TFwM), which are  optimal at an arbitrary rate, are derived for configurations with no,  partial and full information feedback. It is shown that, operating  at full rate, T2TFwM is equivalent to the CMF regardless of in-  formation feedback. However, at a reduced rate, a certain amount  of degradation in fusion accuracy is unavoidable. In contrast to  T2TFwoM, T2TFwM benefits from information feedback.  For nonlinear distributed tracking systems, an approximate    implementation of the T2TF algorithms is proposed. It requires  less communications between the FC and the local trackers, which  allows the algorithms to be implemented in distributed tracking  systems with low communication capacity. Simulation results show  that the proposed approximate implementation is consistent and has  practically no loss in fusion accuracy due to the approximation. For  the sensors-target geometry considered, it can meet the performance  bound of the CMF at the fusion times.  The problem of track-to-track association (T2TA) is also inves-    tigated. The sliding window test for T2TA, which uses track esti-  mates within a time window, is derived. It accounts exactly for the  crosscovariances among the track estimates and yields false alarm  rates that match the theoretical values. To evaluate the test power  when using more data frames, a comparison between the single time  association test and the sliding window test is performed. Counter-  intuitively, it is shown that the belief “the longer the window, the  greater the test power” is not always correct.
