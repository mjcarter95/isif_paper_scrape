<p>   Intent inference involves the analysis of actions and activities of a    target of interest to deduce its purpose. This paper proposes an ap-    proach for intent inference based on aircraft flight profile analysis.    Simulation tests are carried out on flight profiles generated using    different combinations of flight parameters. In each simulation test,    Interacting Multiple Model-based state estimation is carried out to    update the state vectors of the aircraft being monitored. Relevant    variables of the filtered flight trajectory are subsequently used as    inputs for a Mamdani-type fuzzy inference system. Research on two    applications is reported. The first application involves the determi-    nation of the likelihood of weapon delivery by an attack aircraft    under military surveillance. Test results verify that the method is    feasible and is able to provide timely inference. By extending the    method to take the environmental context of the tracked aircraft    into consideration when executing the inference process, it is likely    that the military defenders would be able to raise their alert earlier    against potential adversaries. This would provide them with more    time to react and devise pre-emptive counteraction. The second ap-    plication concerns conformance monitoring in air traffic control sys-    tems. Experimental results show that the proposed solution can be    used to assist air traffic control system operators in determining if    aircraft navigate according to planned trajectories. Consequently,    corrective action can be taken on detection of anomalous behavior.    A brief discussion on extending the proposed method to deal with    multiple aircraft is also presented.
