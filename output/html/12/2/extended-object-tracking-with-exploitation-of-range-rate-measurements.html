<p>   In active sonar and radar target tracking, measurements consist    of position and often also include range rate. Tracking algorithms    use these measurements over time to estimate target state compris-    ing position, velocity and, where applicable, turn rate. In most cases    there is an underlying assumption in the tracking algorithm that the    target is a “point target” (i.e. the target has no physical extent). An-    other common assumption is that at most one measurement per scan    originates from the target. For certain combinations of transmitted    waveform and target type, the resolution of the waveform is such    that the target is “over-resolved” (i.e. the sensor resolution is high    enough that closely spaced scatter centers can be resolved). For such    cases the point target assumption must be replaced with an extended    target assumption. This work provides a methodology to exploit the    extended nature of the target for the case of a rigid target whose    spatial characteristics are fixed with respect to the line of motion.    By employing a combination of the expectation maximization (EM)    algorithm and allowing more than one measurement per scan to    originate from the target, a technique is developed that uses a single    scan of raw measurements that include range, bearing and range    rate to provide an estimate of target position, velocity, heading and    turn rate. This single scan estimate is then used in a nearly constant    turn rate extended Kalman filter to provide a multi-scan estimate    of the target state.
