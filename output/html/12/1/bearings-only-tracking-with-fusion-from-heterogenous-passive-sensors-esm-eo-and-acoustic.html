<p>   Fusion from Heterogenous    Passive Sensors: ESM/EO and    Acoustic    RONG YANG    YAAKOV BAR-SHALOM    GEE WAH NG    The performance of the conventional bearings-only tracking    (BOT) from a single passive sensor hinges on the sensor platform    maneuvers. This paper presents a new BOT approach based on    fusion from two heterogenous bearings-only sensors residing on    the same moving or stationary platform. The two sensors are an    ESM/EO with negligible propagation delay and an acoustic sensor    with significant propagation delay. The time difference between    the reception times of the two sensors (corresponding to the same    emission time) is the acoustic propagation delay. Since target range    information is contained in the acoustic propagation delay (which    is not known but can be estimated), the target state is shown to    be completely observable even when the platform is stationary. The    observability is studied in this paper via the Fisher information    matrix (FIM).    Two estimators are developed. They are the maximum likeli-    hood (ML) estimator for batch estimation and the out-of-sequence    measurements fusion from acoustic and ESM/EO sensors (OOSM-    AE) for recursive estimation. It shows that the ML estimator for    batch estimation attains the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB)–    it is statistically efficient–except in cases with a small number of    measurements and the target heading close to the bearing from    the sensor platform. The OOSM-AE is developed to handle out-of-    sequence measurements (OOSM) due to the acoustic propagation    delay. It consists of an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to handle    the in-sequence ESM/EO measurements and an OOSM unscented    Gauss-Helmert filter (OOSM-UGHF) to handle the out-of-sequence    acoustic measurements. Simulation results are presented to demon-    strate the performance of this new BOT approach.
