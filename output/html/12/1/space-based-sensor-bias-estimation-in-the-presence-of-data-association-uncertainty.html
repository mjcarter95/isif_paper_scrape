<p>   In this paper, an approach to bias estimation in the presence    of measurement association uncertainty using common targets of    opportunity, is developed. Data association is carried out before the    estimation of sensor angle measurement biases. Consequently, the    quality of data association is critical to the overall tracking perfor-    mance. Data association becomes especially challenging if the sen-    sors are passive. Mathematically, the problem can be formulated    as a multidimensional optimization problem, where the objective    is to maximize the generalized likelihood that the associated mea-    surements correspond to common targets, based on target locations    and sensor bias estimates. Applying gating techniques significantly    reduces the size of this problem. The association likelihoods are    evaluated using an exhaustive search after which an acceptance test    is applied to each solution in order to obtain the correct solution.    We demonstrate the merits of this approach by applying it to a    simulated tracking system, which consists of two or three satellites    tracking a ballistic target. We assume the sensors are synchronized,    their locations are known, and we estimate their orientation biases    together with the unknown target locations.
