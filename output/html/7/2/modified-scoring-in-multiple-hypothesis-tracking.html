<p>   Track-oriented multiple-hypothesis tracking is a powerful and    widely-accepted methodology in multi-target tracking. We show    that the target-death problem inherent in the probability hypothesis    density filter does not arise in the MHT. However, the MHT suffers    from a problem of its own: excessive competition for measurements    from tentative tracks. We introduce a mechanism to mitigate this    effect by favoring confirmed tracks in the association process. A    heuristic justification for the technique is that it mitigates the sub-    optimality associated with hypothesis pruning and sequential track    extraction. Perhaps more convincingly, the modification to the MHT    equations is provably optimal in the limiting case of cardinality    tracking with unity detection probability. We show that modified-    scoring MHT improves upon standard MHT in several benchmark    studies.
