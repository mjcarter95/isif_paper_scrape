<p>   Association of spatial information about targets is convention-    ally based on measures such as the Euclidean or the Mahalanobis    distance. These approaches produce satisfactory results when tar-    gets are more distant than the resolution of the employed sensing    principle, but is limited if they lie closer. This paper describes an    association method combined with classification enhancing perfor-    mance. The method not only considers spatial distance, but also    information about class membership during a post-processing step.    Association of measurements that cannot be uniquely associated to    only one estimate, but to multiple estimates, is achieved under the    constraint of conflict minimization of the combination of mutual    class memberships.    With Monte Carlo simulations the performance of this new    method is compared with a Kalman filter. This evaluation is per-    formed in a multi-target environment with unknown correspon-    dence between measurements and targets. The evaluation can not    be only based on the root mean square error (RMSE) of the position    estimate, but requires a performance assessment of the underlying    target number estimation and the association. Therefore, two new    measures are introduced.    The new method outperforms the Kalman filter approach with    respect to association performance and RMSE.
