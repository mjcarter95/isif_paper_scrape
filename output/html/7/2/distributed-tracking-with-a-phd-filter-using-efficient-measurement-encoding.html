<p>   Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filter is a framework for    multitarget tracking, which provides estimates for the number of    targets as well as the individual target states. Sequential Monte    Carlo (SMC) implementation of a PHD filter can be used for non-    linear non-Gaussian problems. However, the application of PHD-    based state estimators for a distributed sensor network, where each    tracking node runs its own PHD-based state estimator, is more    challenging compared with single sensor tracking due to commu-    nication limitations. A distributed state estimator should use the    available communication resources efficiently in order to avoid the    degradation of filter performance. In this paper, a method that effi-    ciently communicates encoded measurements between nodes while    maintaining the filter accuracy is proposed. This coding is com-    plicated in the presence of high clutter and instantaneous target    births. This problem is mitigated using adaptive quantization and    encoding techniques. The performance of the algorithm is quan-    tified using a Posterior Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (PCRLB) that    incorporates quantization errors. Simulation studies are performed    to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.    Manuscript received June 21, 2010; released for publication March    21, 2011.
