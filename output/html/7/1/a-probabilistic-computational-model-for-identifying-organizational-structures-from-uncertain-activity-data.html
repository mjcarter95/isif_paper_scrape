<p>   Uncertain Activity Data    XU HAN    FEILI YU    GEORGIY LEVCHUCK    KRISHNA PATTIPATI    FANG TU    The knowledge of the principles and goals under which an ad-    versary organization operates is required to predict its future activi-    ties. To implement successful counter-actions, additional knowledge    of the specifics of the organizational structures, such as command,    communication, control, and information access networks, as well    as responsibility distribution among members of the organization,    is required. Our focus here is on identifying the mapping between    hypothesized nodes of an adversary command organization (“model    network”) and tracked individuals, resources and activities (“data    network”). We formulate the organizational structure identification    problem as one of associating the nodes of the noisy data network    with the nodes of the model network. The problem of minimizing the    negative log likelihood ratio with respect to the mapping versus null    mapping (thereby capturing the possibility that no hypothesized    model network is a good match) leads to a Quadratic Assignment    Problem (QAP). We solve the QAP using what we call an iterative    m-best soft assignment algorithm, combining Bertsekas’ auction al-    gorithm and Murty’s m-best assignment algorithms in a novel way.    The experimental results show that our probabilistic model and the    m-best soft assignment-based algorithm can accurately identify the    different organizational structures and achieve correct node map-    pings among organizational members under uncertainty. We also    apply the m-best soft assignment algorithm to the general QAP and    compare its performances to the hitherto best solutions.
