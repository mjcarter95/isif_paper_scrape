<p>   This paper investigates distributed tracking with range-Doppler    coupling, where a range measurement of a target of interest is lin-    early biased by its range-rate (or Doppler). The coupling parame-    ter ¸ can be zero, positive, or negative. The posterior Cramér-Rao    bound (PCRB) is derived for distributed radar systems: multistatic    and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) settings. In the mul-    tistatic case, a positive ¸ leads to the lowest PCRB, the same as is    true for monostatic tracking. The paper also compares the track-    ing performance of multistatic and MIMO configurations, where    the latter utilizes two waveforms with §¸ parameters, respectively.  Regarding the power-unlimited case, a MIMO radar can always    outperform a multistatic one from a tracking perspective. However,    if the total power is limited, the situation is somewhat different:    the transmitter co-located configuration is worse than a multistatic    one, while in the widely-separated case the better choice depends    on geometry.
