<p>   Association of tracks formed at different sensors is an ongoing    area of interest in the field of information fusion and target track-    ing. In order to leverage additional information about a current    target of interest that has been tracked at (an) additional sensor(s),    track-to-track association (T2TA) must be performed. In addition    to accurately identifying tracks with common origin, a desirable    T2TA scheme will associate the tracks quickly, i.e., after only a few    samples. A T2TA scheme is developed here that will take advantage    of traditional kinematic state information as well as additional state    information in the form of state augmentation. The main contribu-    tion is the use of two nonlinearly related state augmentations at the    two sensors and accounting for their uncertainties. The results of    T2TA are compared when using only kinematic state information,    only state augmentation information, and the full augmented state.    The full augmented state is shown to provide the most desirable    association results, both in terms of accuracy and the number of    samples needed to provide that accuracy.
