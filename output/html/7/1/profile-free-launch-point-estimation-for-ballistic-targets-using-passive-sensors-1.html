<p>   This paper considers the estimation of the Launch Points (LP)    of ballistic targets from two or more passive satellite-borne sensors    by fusing their angle-only measurements. The targets are assumed    to have a two-stage boost phase with a free-flight phase between    the two stages. Due to the passive nature of the sensors, there is    no measurement during the free-flight motion. It is also assumed    that measurements are available only after a few seconds from    the launch time due to cloud cover. In the literature, profile-    based methods have been proposed to estimate the target’s launch    point and trajectory. Profile-based methods normally result in large    errors when there is a mismatch between actual and assumed    profiles, which is the case in most scenarios. In this paper, a    profile-free method is proposed to estimate the target states at    the End-of-Burnout (EOB) and LP. Estimates at the EOB are    obtained by using forward-filtering with adaptive model selection    based on boost phase changes. The LP estimates are obtained using    smoothing followed by backward prediction. Uncertainties in the    motion model and the launch time must be incorporated in the    backward prediction. The LP estimate and the corresponding error    covariance are obtained by incorporating the above uncertainties.    Simulation results illustrating the performance of the proposed    approach are presented.
