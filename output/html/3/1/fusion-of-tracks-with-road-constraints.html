<p>   This paper is concerned with tracking of ground targets on roads    and investigates possible ways to improve target state estimation via    fusing a target’s track with information about the road along which    the target is traveling. A target track is estimated using a surveil-    lance radar whereas a digital map provides the road network of the    region under surveillance. When the information about roads is as    accurate as (or even better than) radar measurements, it is desired    naturally to incorporate such information (fusion) into target state    estimation. In this paper, roads are modeled with analytic functions    and their fusion with a target track is cast as linear or nonlinear    state constraints in an optimization procedure. The constrained op-    timization is then solved with the Lagrangian multiplier, leading to    a closed-form solution for linear constraints and an iterative solu-    tion for second-order nonlinear constraints. Geometric interpreta-    tions of the solutions are provided for special cases. Compared to    other methods, the track-to-road fusion using the constrained opti-    mization technique can be easily implemented as an add-on mod-    ule without changes to an existing tracker. For curved roads with    coarse waypoints, the nonlinear constrained solution outperforms    the piecewise linearized constrained approach. Computer simula-    tion results are presented to illustrate the algorithms.
