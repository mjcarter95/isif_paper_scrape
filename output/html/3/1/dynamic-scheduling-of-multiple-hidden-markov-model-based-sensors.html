<p>   In this paper, a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based dynamic  sensor scheduling problem is formulated, and solved using infor-  mation gain and rollout concepts to overcome the computational  intractability of the dynamic programming recursion. The problem  involves dynamically sequencing a set of sensors to monitor mul-  tiples tasks, which are modeled as multiple HMMs with multiple  emission matrices corresponding to each of the sensors. The dy-  namic sequencing problem is to minimize the sum of sensor usage  costs and the task state estimation error costs. The rollout infor-  mation gain algorithm proposed herein employs the information  gain heuristic as the base algorithm to solve the dynamic sensor  sequencing problem. The information gain heuristic selects the best  sensor assignment at each time epoch that maximizes the sum of  information gains per unit sensor usage cost, subject to the assign-  ment constraints that at most one sensor can be assigned to a HMM  and that at most one HMM can be assigned to a sensor. The roll-  out strategy involves combining the information gain heuristic with  the Jonker-Volgenant-Castañ _on (JVC) assignment algorithm and a  modified Murty’s algorithm to compute the ·-best assignments at  each decision epoch of rollout. The capabilities of the rollout infor-  mation gain algorithm are illustrated using a hypothetical scenario  to monitor intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) ac-  tivities in multiple fishing villages and refugee camps for the pres-  ence of weapons and terrorists or refugees.
