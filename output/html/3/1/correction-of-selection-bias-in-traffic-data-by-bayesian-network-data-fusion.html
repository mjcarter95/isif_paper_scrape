<p>   In this paper a method is introduced based on the concept    of Bayesian Networks (BNs), which is applied to model sensor    fusion. Sensors can be characterised as real time variant systems    with specific physical functional principles, allowing to determine    the value of a physical state of interest within certain ranges    of tolerance. The measurements of the sensors are affected by    external, e.g. environmental conditions, and internal conditions, e.g.    the physical life of the sensor and its components. These effects can    cause selection bias, which yields corrupted data. For this reason,    the underlying process, the measurements, the external and internal    conditions are considered in the BN model for data fusion. The    effectiveness of the approach is underlined on the basis of vehicle    classification in traffic surveillance. The results of our simulations    show, that the accuracy of the estimates of the vehicle classes is    increased by more than 60%.
