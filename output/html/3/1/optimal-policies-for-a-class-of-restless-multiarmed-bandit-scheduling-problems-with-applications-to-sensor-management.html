Washburn received his B.S. in 1973 from Yale University in mathematics and his Ph.D. in 1979 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in applied mathematics. He has been a principal scientist at Parietal-Systems, Inc. (PSI) since January 2006. At PSI he is developing algorithms for constraint-based data association, sensor resource management, and pattern recognition for information fusion appli- cations. Before joining PSI, Dr. Washburn worked at ALPHATECH for 23 years, where he was a Chief Scientist and during which time he led research and devel- opment in several areas of information fusion and sensor management. His work included the development of multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) and correlation algorithms for several applications, and development and application of multi- resolution statistical image fusion algorithms and performance estimation theory for model-based target recognition algorithms. He led the efforts on sensor resource management, using approximate dynamic programming approaches to develop effi- cient control algorithms for pointing sensors and selecting sensor modes for sensing multiple targets. Dr. Washburn is a member of the IEEE, American Mathematical Society, and Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. Michael K. Schneider received his B.S.E. degree in electrical engineering and Certificate in applied and computational mathematics (Summa Cum Laude) from Princeton University in 1994, and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineer- ing and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1996 and 2001, respectively. He is a lead research engineer at BAE Systems Advanced Information Technolo- gies (BAE AIT) where, since 2001, he has been working on problems in information fusion. At BAE AIT, he has been developing combinatorial optimization algorithms for sensor resource management as well as algorithms for signature-aided tracking and analysis of patterns in historical track data. He is a member of IEEE, SIAM, and INFORMS. WASHBURN & SCHNEIDER: OPTIMAL POLICIES 13</li>
