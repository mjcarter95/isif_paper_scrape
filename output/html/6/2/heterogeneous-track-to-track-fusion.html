<p>   Track-to-track fusion using estimates from multiple sensors can    achieve better estimation performance than single sensor track-    ing. If the local sensors use different system models in different    state spaces, the problem of heterogeneous track-to-track fusion    arises. Compared with homogeneous track-to-track fusion that as-    sumes the same system model for different sensors, the heteroge-    neous case poses two major challenges. The first one is that we    have to fuse estimates from different state spaces (related by a cer-    tain nonlinear transformation). The second is the estimation errors’    dependence problem, which is generally recognized as the “com-    mon process noise effect.” Different heterogeneous track-to-track    fusion approaches, namely, the linear minimum mean square er-    ror approach and the maximum likelihood approach, are presented    and compared with the corresponding centralized measurement    tracker/fuser (also known as measurement-to-track fuser).
