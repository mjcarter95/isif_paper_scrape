<p>   The track-to-track association problem is to determine the pair-    ing of sensor-level tracks that correspond to the same true target    from which the sensor-level tracks originated. This problem is cru-    cial for multisensor data fusion and is complicated by the presence    of individual sensor biases, random errors, false tracks, and missed    tracks. A popular approach to performing track-to-track associa-    tion between two sensor systems is to jointly optimize the a poste-    riori relative bias estimate between the sensors and the likelihood    of track-to-track association. Algorithms that solve this problem    typically generate the K best bias-association hypotheses and corre-    sponding bias-association likelihoods. In this paper, we extend the    above approach in two ways. First, we derive a closed-form expres-    sion for computing “pure” track-to-track association likelihoods,    as opposed to bias-association likelihoods which are weighted by    a unique relative bias estimate. Second, we present an alternative    formulation of the track-to-track association problem in which we    optimize solely with respect to marginal association likelihoods. Fi-    nally, we provide two algorithms that find theK provably best track-    to-track associations with respect to our new likelihood function.    These results facilitate what is commonly known as system-level    track ambiguity management.
