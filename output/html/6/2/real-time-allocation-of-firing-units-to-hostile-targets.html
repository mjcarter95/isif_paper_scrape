<p>   The protection of defended assets such as military bases and    population centers against hostile targets (e.g., aircrafts, missiles,    and rockets) is a highly relevant problem in the military conflicts    of today and tomorrow. In order to neutralize threats of this kind,    they have to be detected and engaged before causing any damage to    the defended assets. We review algorithms for solving the resource    allocation problem in real-time, and empirically investigate their    performance using the open source testbed SWARD. The results    show that many of the tested algorithms produce high quality    solutions for small-scale problems. A novel variant of particle swarm    optimization seeded with an enhanced greedy algorithm is described    and is shown to perform best for large instances of the real-time    allocation problem.
