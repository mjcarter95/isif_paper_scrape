TRACK-TO-TRACK ASSOCIATION AND AMBIGUITY MANAGEMENT IN THE PRESENCE OF SENSOR BIAS 99 Dimitri Papageorgiou holds a B.S. in mathematics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and an M.S. in operations research and industrial engineering from the University of Texas at Austin. He is currently finishing his Ph.D. in opera- tions research under the aegis of George Nemhauser in the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. He is a recipient of a U.S. National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and was the only person in the country pursuing a doctorate in the field of operations research to receive this honor in his year. As a former member of Raytheon’s Center for Discrimination, he has been involved in projects related to sensor resource management, multi-target tracking, and data association, and has co-authored several papers in these areas.</li>
