<p>   In multisensor target tracking systems, measurements from dif-    ferent sensors on the same target typically exhibit biases. These bi-    ases can be accounted for as fixed random variables by the Schmidt-    Kalman filter. Furthermore, measurements from the same target    can arrive out of sequence. Recently, a procedure for updating the    state with a multistep-lag “out-of-sequence” measurement (OOSM)    using the simpler “1-step-lag” algorithm was developed for the sit-    uation without measurement biases. The present work presents the    solution to the combined problem of handling biases from multi-    ple sensors when their measurements arrive out of sequence. The    state update with an OOSM is derived first for a KF tracker. This    technique is then extended to the case where the tracker is an IMM    estimator.
