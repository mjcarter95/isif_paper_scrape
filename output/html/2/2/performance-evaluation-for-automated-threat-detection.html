<p>   We have developed a performance evaluation laboratory (PE  Lab) to assess automated technologies that fuse fragmentary, par-  tial information about individuals’ activities to detect modeled ter-  rorist threat individuals, groups, and events whose evidence traces  are embedded in a background dominated by evidence from sim-  ilarly modeled non-threat phenomena. We have developed the PE  Lab’s main components–a test dataset generator and a hypothesis  scorer–to address two key challenges of counter-terrorism threat  detection performance evaluation:    ² Acquiring adequate test data to support systematic experimenta-  tion; and    ² Scoring structured hypotheses that reflect modeled threat objects’  attribute values and inter-relationships.    The generator is parameterized so that the threat detection  problem’s difficulty may be varied along multiple dimensions (e.g.,  dataset size, signal-to-noise ratio, evidence corruption level). We  describe and illustrate, using a case study, our methodology for  constraint-based experiment design and non-parametric statistical  analysis to identify which among varied dataset characteristics most  influence a given technology’s performance on a given detection  task.  The scorer generalizes metrics (precision, recall, F-value, area    under curve) traditional in information retrieval to accommo-  date partial matching over structured case hypothesis objects with  weighted attributes. Threat detection technologies may process  time-stamped evidence in either batch, forensic mode (to tender  threat event hypotheses retrospectively) or in incremental, warn-  ing mode (to tender event hypotheses prospectively–as “alerts”).  Alerts present additional scoring issues (e.g., timeliness) for which  we discuss practical techniques.  PE Lab technology should be similarly effective for information    fusion or situation assessment technologies applied in other domains  (besides counter-terrorism), where performance evaluation presents  similar challenges.
