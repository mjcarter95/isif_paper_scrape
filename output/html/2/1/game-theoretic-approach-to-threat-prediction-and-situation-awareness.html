<p> Air Force Research Laboratory    The strategy of data fusion has been applied in threat prediction  and situation awareness. The terminology has been standardized  by the Joint Directors of Laboratories (JDL) in the form of a so-  called “JDL Data-Fusion Model.” Higher levels of the model call  for prediction of future development and awareness of the devel-  opment of a situation. It is known that the Bayesian Network is  an insightful approach to determine optimal strategies against an  asymmetric adversarial opponent. However, it lacks the essential ad-  versarial decision processes perspective. In this paper, a data-fusion  approach for asymmetric-threat detection and prediction based on  advanced knowledge infrastructure and stochastic (Markov) game  theory is proposed. Asymmetric and adaptive threats are detected  and grouped by intelligent agent and Hierarchical Entity Aggrega-  tion in level-two fusion and their intents are predicted by a decen-  tralized Markov (stochastic) game model with deception in level-  three fusion. We have evaluated the feasibility of the advanced data  fusion algorithm and its effectiveness through extensive simulations.
