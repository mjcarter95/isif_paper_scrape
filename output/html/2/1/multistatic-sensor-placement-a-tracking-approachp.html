<p> NATO Undersea Research Centre    Active sonar tracking using measurements from multistatic sen-    sors has shown promise: there are benefits in terms of robustness,    complementarity (covariance-ellipse intersection) and of course sim-    ply due to the increased probability of detection that naturally ac-    crues from a well-designed data fusion system. It is not always clear    what the placement of the sources and receivers that gives the best    fused measurement covariance for any target–or at least for any    target that is of interest–might be. In this paper, we investigate the    problem as one of global optimization, in which the objective is to    maximize the information provided to the tracker.    We assume that the number of sensors is given, so that the    optimization is done in a continuous space. The strong variability    of target strength as a function of aspect is integral to the cost    function we optimize. Doppler information is not discarded when    constant frequency (Doppler-sensitive) waveforms are available. The    optimal placements that result are consistent with our intuition,    suggesting that our placement strategy may provide a useful tool in    more complex scenarios where intuition is challenged.
