<p>   This work derives the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for an    acoustic target and sensor localization system in which the noise    characteristics may depend on the location of the source. The sys-    tem itself has been previously examined, but without deriving the    CRLB and showing the statistical efficiency of the estimator used.    Three different versions of the CRLB are derived, one in which    direction of arrival (DOA) and (shockwave based) range measure-    ments are available (“local estimate” based CRLB), one in which    two types of DOA measurements and the time difference between    them is available (“native measurement” based CRLB), and one in    which only DOA measurements (bearing) are available (“bearings-    only” CRLB). In each case, the estimator is found to be statistically    efficient; but, depending on the sensor-target geometry, the range    measurements may or may not significantly contribute to the accu-    racy of target localization. Additionally, the native measurements    are found to result in superior localization when compared to the    use of the range estimates.
